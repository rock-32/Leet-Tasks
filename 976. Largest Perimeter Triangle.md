# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle.md
*Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.*

### Example 1:  
Input: nums = [2,1,2]  
Output: 5  
Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.  

### Example 2:  
Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]  
Output: 0  
Explanation:   
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.  
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.  
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.  
As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.

My Solutions:

public class Solution {
    public int LargestPerimeter(int[] nums) {
        Array.Sort(nums);
        bool isValid(int a,int b,int c) {
            return a+b>c; 
        }
        for(int i=nums.Length-1; i >= 2; i--){
            if(isValid(nums[i-2],nums[i-1],nums[i])){
                return nums[i-2]+nums[i-1]+nums[i];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
