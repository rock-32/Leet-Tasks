# 2418. Sort the People.md
*You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.
For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.*  

### Example 1:  
Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]  
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]  
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.  

### Example 2:  
Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]  
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]  
Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

My Solutions:

/**
 * @param {string[]} names
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var sortPeople = function(names, heights) {
    let hight = [...heights]
    let heightarr =heights.sort((a,b)=>b-a);
    let arr = []

    for (let i=0; i<heightarr.length ; i++){
        for (let y=0;y<hight.length ; y++ ){
            if(heightarr[i]===hight[y]){
                arr[i] = names[y]
            }
        }
    }   
    return arr
};

```
