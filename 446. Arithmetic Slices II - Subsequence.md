# 446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.

public class Solution {
    public int NumberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.Length;
        int total_count = 0;
        Dictionary<int, int>[] dp = new Dictionary<int, int>[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                long diff = (long)nums[i] - nums[j]; 
                if (diff > int.MaxValue || diff < int.MinValue) {
                    continue; 
                }
                int diffInt = (int)diff;
                dp[i][diffInt] = dp[i].GetValueOrDefault(diffInt) + 1;  
                if (dp[j].ContainsKey(diffInt)) {
                    dp[i][diffInt] += dp[j][diffInt];
                    total_count += dp[j][diffInt];
                }
            }
        }
        return total_count;
    }
}
