# 1496. Path Crossing

*Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively.  
You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.  
Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.*  

### Example 1:  
Input: path = "NES"  
Output: false   
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.  

### Example 2:  
Input: path = "NESWW"  
Output: true  
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.

My Solutions:

public class Solution {
    public bool IsPathCrossing(string path) {
        if (path == null || path == string.Empty)
            return false;    
        int x = 0,
            y = 0;
        HashSet<string> set = new HashSet<string>();
        set.Add(x + "-" + y);
        foreach (var c in path)
        {
            if (c == 'N')
                x += 1;
            else if (c == 'S')
                x -= 1;
            else if (c == 'E')
                y += 1;
            else
                y -= 1;         
            if (set.Contains(x + "-" +y))
                return true;           
            set.Add(x + "-" +y);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
