# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately  
*You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order,   
starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.  
Return the merged string.*  

### Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"  
Output: "apbqcr"  
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:  
word1:  a   b   c   
word2:    p   q   r    
merged: a p b q c r  

### Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"  
Output: "apbqrs"  
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.  
word1:  a   b   
word2:    p   q   r   s  
merged: a p b q   r   s  
  
### Example 3:  
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"  
Output: "apbqcd"  
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.  
word1:  a   b   c   d  
word2:    p   q   
merged: a p b q c   d  

```javascript
My Solutions:
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
    word1.split('')
    let str=''
    for(let i=0;i<word1.length;i++){
        if(word1[i]){
            str+=word1[i]
        }
        if(word1[i+1]){
            str+=word2.slice(i,i+1);
        }
        else{
           str+=word2.slice(i); 
        }
    }
    return str;
};
```
